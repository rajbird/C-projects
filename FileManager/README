*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
Whenever user is asked to input a value, user should follow instructions as
best as possible to avoid segmentation faults or other errors caused by
scanf. For example, when asked menu option if user doesn't enter a number
an infinite loop will continuously print menu options to the screen.

When entering file names to, try to follow character limitations.

Cannot perform operations on directory if the directory has files/folders
inside of it.

**************
Design Choices
**************
When user is asked to supply a file name, they are given 3 chances to give
a valid file name. But when user is asked to give a directory name they
only get one chance.
