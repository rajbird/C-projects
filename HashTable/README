This program hashes phones

************
Compilation
************
Makefile makes 2 executable called A2runnable and test.


***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
To run the menu driven program type in the following into cmd
    ./bin/A2runnable docs/data/data1.txt

Essentially a test file containing a numbers and names is needed, I have made 5
different data files used to test the menu driven program, in the docs/data
dir. File names: data(0-5).txt eg. data1.txt

To run the hash table tester type in the following into cmd
    ./bin/test


*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
Whenever user is asked to input a value, user should follow instructions as
best as possible to avoid segmentation faults or other errors caused by
scanf. For example, when asked menu option if user doesn't enter a number
an infinite loop will continuously print menu options to the screen. Another
an example is when asked to enter a number for entry or search, the number has
to be 10 digits for the number to be found correctly, or segfault.

When entering names to store, the name has to be less than 100 characters.

When entering files to store, file has to be less than 99 characters,
moreover, the file has to exist. Additionally, the last line in the file has
to be a new line.
