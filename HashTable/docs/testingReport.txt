TESTING REPORT


To test the hash ADT, I create an array that stored randomly generated numbers. I then
passed those numbers in as keys, and a string as the value to store in a hash table. This
tested the create, insert and hash functions. Using the hash table with the stored values
I tested the other functions. Additionally, I tested the functions by passing NULL values.

In the hash function I generate the hash table index, by taking the keys mod with the 
length of the hash table. For example, if the key = 30 and length of the hash table = 4, 
then the index generated = 2. To deal with collisions I created a modified linear probing
method. But instead of only checking to the right, I check if a position is open to the left
and right of an index generated. If no position is available I add 3 to the index generated
to check from that position onwards. For example, if the index value is 4, I would check if 
there are any available spots in index positions 3 and 5. If there isn't, the check is then 
done from index position 7.

To test the menu driven program I created 5 different data files, with varying pieces of data.
The first 2 files are quite simple and don't meet the requirements to have more than 20 lines.
I used these files when I was still working through the basics operations of the menu program.
At this point, I was debugging and making sure each function did what it was supposed to. 
Eventually, I made files that were longer, to test the overall capabilities and success of the
of the program.
