Maze Solver

************
Compilation
************
Makefile makes 2 executable called A1runnable and test.


***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
To run the maze solver type in the following into cmd
    ./bin/A1runnable docs/maps/map9.txt

Essentially a test file containing a map is needed, I have made 10 
different map files used to test the maze solver, in the docs/mazes
dir. File names: map(0-9).txt eg. map3.txt

To run the stack tester type in the following into cmd
    ./bin/test


*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
The file containing the maze should only contain the maze, there
cannot be any new lines after the maze. If there are the maze
the solver will not be able to print out the maze solution.

Secondly, each maze must contain a start and finish character,
otherwise, there will be a segmentation fault.
